ASYNCHRONOUS PROGRAMMING:

    I/O operations
    network requests
    improving application responsiveness
    dealing with back-end services

Challenges of Asynchronous Programming
While beneficial, asynchronous programming presents challenges, especially in managing concurrency and debugging.

Concurrency management: Handling multiple tasks without causing conflicts can be complex, particularly when tasks depend on each other.

Debugging difficulties: Asynchronous operations can make it harder to trace errors, as tasks run independently of the main flow.

Code readability: With many operations running concurrently, keeping track of what happens when can complicate code maintenance.

PRACTICE QUIZ:

1. What is a key feature of asynchronous programming?
    Tasks run independently of the main program flow

2. Which of the following is a challenge associated with asynchronous programming?
    Managing cuncurrency in code

3. How does asynchronous programming handle tasks compared to synchronous programming?
    Asynchronous programming allows tasks to run in parallel without blocking others, while synchronous programming runs tasks one at the time

PRACTICE QUIZ:

1. What is the purpose of the async keyword in C#?
    It allows a method to execute without blocking the main thread

2. Which of the following statements about await in C# is correct?
    It pauses method execution until the awaited task is complete

3. What is the correct way to call an asynchronous method using await in C#?
    async Task CallMethodAsynch() {
        await SomeAsyncMethod();
    }
